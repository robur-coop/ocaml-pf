# ocaml-pf

An [Angstrom-based](https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom) parser for the
[FreeBSD pf](https://www.unix.com/man-page/freebsd/5/pf.conf/) firewall configuration format.

## implementation status

Ticked below are the *lines* that are (at least partially) implemented.

- [x] `macro` definitions (NB: macro *expansion* is **NOT**)
- [x] `option`
- [x] `pf-rule`
- [x] `nat-rule`
- [ ] `binat-rule`
- [x] `rdr-rule`
- [ ] `antispoof-rule`
- [x] `altq-rule`
- [x] `queue-rule`
- [x] `trans-anchors`
- [ ] `anchor-rule`
- [ ] `anchor-close`
- [x] `load-anchor`
- [x] `table-rule`
- [x] `include`

## contributing

- I would be very grateful for examples of rules that trip the parser - please
[file an issue ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/cfcs/ocaml-pf/issues/new).

- Ideas regarding the AST, the API, or other suggestions are also very welcome.

- It is always nice with improvements to the pretty-printers! :-)

- Support for more *lines* is a goal, you can help by writing PRs or submitting examples of syntax that is not handled by the parser.

- Before taking on larger rewrites, please get in touch so we can avoid merge conflicts.

## compiling the example

First, install the dependencies:
```shell
opam pin add -n pf .
opam install --deps-only pf

# build test executable, self-test rules from 'man pf.conf':
jbuilder runtest
```

This will give you the `parse_conf.exe` utility that you can use to parse
firewall configuration files:
```
./_build/default/test/parse_conf.exe /home/me/my-pf-file.conf
Reading "/home/me/my-pf-file.conf"
Line 0: ext_bridge = "external"
Read 1 lines!
```
